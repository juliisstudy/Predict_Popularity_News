![project](https://github.com/juliisstudy/predict_Popularity_News/assets/31259481/437fe2e8-5a0b-4898-bd25-0603349e355a)

## About the Project
The project aims to experiment the classification models that were claimed in the paper, A Proactive Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for Predicting the Popularity of Online News.
The four models:
<ul>
  <li>Random Forest (RF)</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF)</li>
  <li>K-NearestNeighbors (KNN)</li>
  <li>Naive Bayes (NB) </li>
</ul>
I tested the different sets of data attributes: all attributes, the attributes selected by CfsSubsetEval, and the attributes selected on the paper.
The experimental results jusified the claims in the paper. **Random Forest (RF)** has the highest prediction accuracy rate.
